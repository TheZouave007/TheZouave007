Hi, I’m @TheZouave007

I’m interested primarily in writing good software and making things that are good. To that end, I am primarily interested in statically typed, compiled languages without garbage collectors.

I’m currently learning how computer graphics work and why quaternions are good.

I’m looking to collaborate on API design, the hardware-software interface, and making good programmer experiences.
