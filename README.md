Hi, I’m @TheZouave007

I’m interested in getting as close to the hardware as possible. My favorite languages tend to be statically typed, non-garbage-collected languages, but everyone knows a good programmer can be effective in any language.

I’m looking to collaborate on API design, the hardware-software interface, and making good programmer experiences.
